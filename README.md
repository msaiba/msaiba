## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Neural networks (activation functions, backprop, all the fun stuff)
- Model evaluation & MLOps basics
- How to turn messy data into meaningful stories

---

## 🛠️ My Toolbox
**Languages & Tools:**  
🐍 Python | 📊 Power BI | 🗂️ SQL | 🔬 R  

**ML Libraries I'm exploring:**  
TensorFlow | PyTorch | scikit-learn | Pandas | NumPy
