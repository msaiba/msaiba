## 🌟 Welcome to my little corner of GitHub

Hi, I'm **Saiba** — a curious human who loves math, data and building things.

🎓 Studied **Applied Mathematics** & **Biomedicine** at **Monash University**  
📊 Started in **Data Analytics**  
🤖 Now training to be a **Machine Learning Engineer**

## 🧠 Current Adventure: Neural Networks, Game Theory
Right now I'm learning:
- Why gradients matter
- How backprop *actually* works
- Similating social influence
- The difference between “it trains” and “it learns something useful” 😅  

Stay tuned for my upcoming ML projects — they’re arriving soon!

## 🧰 Skills & Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn)
- **Power BI** (dashboard building, data storytelling)
- **SQL** (querying, cleaning, transforming)
- **R** (statistics & visualization)

## 🌻 Fun Facts
- I can talk for hours 
- I love visualising data *almost* as much as I love cleaning it  
- My coding playlist is 90% lo-fi
